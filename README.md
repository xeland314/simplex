# Simplex Solver

A comprehensive tool for solving linear programming problems, offering multiple interfaces including a command-line solver, a Domain Specific Language (DSL), and a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

### Core Simplex Solver
The core solver is implemented using `scipy.optimize.linprog` and provides the fundamental capabilities for solving linear programming problems. It handles maximization and minimization, various inequality types (`<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`), and equality constraints (`=`).

### Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)

#### 1. String-based DSL
Define your linear programming problems using a human-readable string format. This DSL supports both direct string input and loading from standard `.lp` files. It automatically handles variable types, including "free" variables by converting them into a pair of non-negative variables.

**Example Usage (String Input):**
```python
from dsl import DSL

problem = DSL("""
MINIMIZE z = 3*x1 + 5*x2
SUBJECT TO
    2*x1 + x2 >= 8
    x1 + 3*x2 >= 9
    x1 <= 5
    x2 >= 1
BOUNDS
    x1 >= 0
    x2 free
""")

simplex = problem.to_simplex()
simplex.solve_problem()
simplex.show_results()
```

**Example Usage (LP File Input):**
```python
from dsl import DSL

# Assuming 'my_problem.lp' contains the problem definition
problem = DSL("my_problem.lp")
simplex = problem.to_simplex()
simplex.solve_problem()
simplex.show_results()
```

#### 2. Pythonic DSL
For a more integrated and programmatic approach, use the Pythonic DSL inspired by `sympy`. Define variables and construct your objective function and constraints directly using Python objects and operators.

**Example Usage:**
```python
from pythonic_dsl import Model, Var, maximize

m = Model("example_lp")

x1 = Var("x1", low=0)
x2 = Var("x2", low=0)

m += maximize(5 * x1 + 4 * x2)
m += (6 * x1 + 4 * x2 <= 24)
m += (x1 + 2 * x2 <= 6)
m += (-x1 + x2 <= 1)
m += (x2 <= 2)

result = m.solve()
result.show_results()
```

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A user-friendly desktop application built with PySide6 (Qt for Python) provides an interactive environment for defining, solving, and visualizing linear programming problems.

-   **Input Widget:** A text editor where you can type or load your problem definition.
-   **Results Table:** Displays the optimal values for variables and the objective function.
-   **Plotting:** For problems with two variables, a dedicated tab visualizes the constraints and the optimal solution point.
-   **Console Log:** Redirects and displays all terminal output (e.g., `print` statements, error messages) within a dedicated tab in the GUI, ensuring readability by stripping ANSI escape codes. Includes a "Clear Console" button.
-   **Menu Bar:**
    -   **File:**
        -   `Open`: Load problem definitions from `.lp` or `.txt` files.
        -   `Save`: Save the current problem definition from the editor to an `.lp` file.
        -   `Quit`: Exit the application.
    -   **Help:**
        -   `About`: Displays a custom dialog with application information, author, license, and links to GitHub and donation pages.
-   **User Experience:**
    -   Responsive UI: The solver runs in a separate thread to prevent the application from freezing during calculations.
    -   Custom application icon (`pixel-cat.png`).
    -   Uses the FiraCode font for enhanced readability and a modern aesthetic.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xeland314/simplex.git
    cd simplex
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line (Interactive)
Run the basic interactive solver:
```bash
python simplex.py
```

### DSL (Programmatic)
Integrate the DSLs into your Python scripts as shown in the "Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)" section above.

### GUI Application
Launch the graphical interface:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Examples
Check the `examples/` directory for sample `.lp` and `.txt` files that can be loaded into the GUI or used with the DSLs.

## Development
-   **Testing:** Run all unit tests with:
    ```bash
    uv run python -m unittest discover
    ```
