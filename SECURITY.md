# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, security updates are provided only for the latest stable release. I encourage all users to upgrade/use to the newest version to ensure they have the latest security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v0.1.1  | :white_check_mark: |
| < v0.1.1| :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to report

1. **Do not open a public issue.** This helps protect other users until a fix is available.
2. Use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature (go to the "Security" tab of this repository and select "Advisories" -> "Report a vulnerability").
3. Alternatively, you can contact me directly via the contact information provided in my GitHub profile.

### What to expect

* **Response time:** I will acknowledge your report within 48-72 hours.
* **Update:** I will keep you informed of the progress as I work on a fix.
* **Recognition:** If the vulnerability is confirmed and fixed, I will gladly provide credit/acknowledgment in the release notes or README, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Compensation

Please note that this is a personal open-source project. I **do not offer financial rewards (bug bounties)** at this time. Contributions are appreciated as part of the community spirit of open-source software.
